I started my career doing tech support on Wall Street for a 3GL PowerBuilder competitor, covering their UK customers from their office on John St.  The hours sucked, and my days started at 5AM, but hey the bagels weren't bad.  I then did a stint doing pre-sales at Sybase out of the Grace Building, focusing on their data modeling products.

Late '99 I got bored of NYC and moved to SF, and worked for a few startups there - doing everything from supply chain logistics, to real time middleware, and then finally master data management.  After SF, I moved to Hong Kong in '08
where I continued to work in MDM as a consultant and then finally promoted to a regional architecture/engineering role.  I was laid off in late 2023 (2 rounds that year, and this round seemed to focus on senior folks only).  I'm thankful this happened because it gave me the freedom to work on something interesting to me.  For at least a little while.

Thanks for getting this far.  I'll be periodically updating this blog with my findings as I work on building a product that I hope will provide people a mental break, that can foster stronger family connections, a space for introspection and sanity in this world of
toxic social media, dopamine inducing addictive shorts, predatory engagement farming, and all the rest.
