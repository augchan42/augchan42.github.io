I've spent most of my career working in enterprise software.  My first job was doing tech support for a 3GL PowerBuilder competitor, covering their UK customers from their office on John St. in downtown Manhattan.  The hours sucked, and my days started at 5AM, but hey the bagels weren't bad.  I then did a stint doing pre-sales at Sybase out of the Grace Building, focusing on their data modeling products.

 Late '99 I got bored of NYC and moved to SF, and worked for a few startups there - doing verything from supply chain logistics, to real time middleware, and then finally master data management.  After SF, I moved to Hong Kong in '08
where I continued to work in MDM as a consultant and then finally promoted to a regional architecture/engineering role.  I was laid off in late 2023 (2 rounds that year, and a LOT of senior people were let go during the 2nd round).  I worked for a mid-size company and I see a lot of challenges for companies of that size - pressure above from hyperscalars who sell everything under the sun as a hosted offering (Microsoft/Google/Amazon).  And pressure below from open source and software startups that can offer free or very low cost software, with discords providing excellent support from actual engineers.

Thanks for getting this far.  I'll be periodically updating this blog with my findings as I work on building a product that I hope will provide people a mental break, that can foster stronger family connections, a space for introspection and sanity in this world of
toxic social media, dopamine inducing addictive shorts, predatory engagement farming, and all the rest.
