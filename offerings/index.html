      I'm passionate about helping founders and companies bring their visions to life and navigate complex technical landscapes. My approach is flexible and tailored to your specific needs. Here's how we can start:
    </p>

  <section class="portfolio-section">
    <h3 class="portfolio-section-subtitle">1. Initial Consultation (No Charge)</h3>
    <p class="portfolio-text">
      Every great collaboration begins with understanding. I never charge for our first meeting. This is an informal discussion—perhaps over coffee or a virtual call—where I aim to learn more about what you're building, the challenges your company is facing, or the ideas you're hoping to explore. It's an opportunity for me to share my perspective and for us to see if there's a good mutual fit.

    <h3 class="portfolio-section-subtitle">2. MVP Development &amp; Scaling Assistance</h3>
    <p class="portfolio-text">
      For startups and new ventures, getting the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) right is crucial. I can help you architect, build, and iterate on your MVP.
    </p>
    <ul class="portfolio-list">
      <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Typically, this involves an hourly rate combined with an equity share.</li>
      <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> I understand the realities of early-stage startups. Terms are negotiable, especially if your venture is pre-funding and equity is the primary initial capital.</li>
      <li><strong>Commitment:</strong> I selectively engage with projects where I genuinely believe in the founder's vision, the product's potential, or ideally, both.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="portfolio-section">
    <h3 class="portfolio-section-subtitle">3. Fractional CTO / Strategic Technical Leadership</h3>
    <p class="portfolio-text">
      If your organization needs experienced technical leadership on a flexible basis, I can step in as a Fractional CTO. This can involve strategic planning, team mentorship, architectural oversight, or hands-on problem-solving.
    </p>
    <ul class="portfolio-list">
      <li><strong>Structure:</strong> This can be structured as a monthly retainer, an equity share, or a combination, depending on the engagement's scope, the strength of your team, and my conviction in the product's success.</li>
      <li><strong>Goal:</strong> To provide high-level technical guidance and execution capability without the overhead of a full-time executive, making top-tier expertise accessible.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="portfolio-section">
    <h3 class="portfolio-section-subtitle">A Modern Approach to Agreeing on Terms</h3>
    <p class="portfolio-text">
      Transparency and fairness are key to a successful partnership. For determining specific rates and equity percentages, I favor AI adjudication.  I can share details if we get to this stage.
