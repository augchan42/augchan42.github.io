    <h2 class="portfolio-section-title">Why Work With Me?</h2>
    <p class="portfolio-text">
      For over two decades, I've been turning ambitious ideas into scalable software. At <strong><a href="https://www.informatica.com/" class="portfolio-link" target="_blank">Informatica</a></strong>, I re-architected critical systems achieving a <strong>200% performance boost</strong> through linear scaling and dynamic workload distribution. More recently, I've pioneered in Web3 and AI, building <strong><a href="https://8bitoracle.ai" class="portfolio-link" target="_blank">8-Bit Oracle</a></strong> - an innovative digital divination project that <a href="https://x.com/origin_trail/status/1892543087479505352" class="portfolio-link" target="_blank"><strong>won at the Consensus HK Hackathon</strong></a>.
    </p>
    <p class="portfolio-text">
      I've also partnered with driven founders at ventures like <strong><a href="https://www.peepsapp.ai/" class="portfolio-link" target="_blank">People App</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.travelbox.tech/" class="portfolio-link" target="_blank">Travelbox</a></strong>, bringing both deep engineering expertise and a founder's mindset to every challenge.
    </p>
    <p class="portfolio-text">
      Whether you need your team trained on AI workflows, an MVP built, systems scaled, or strategic technical leadership, I offer hard-won experience, cutting-edge technical knowledge, and the relentless drive of a startup builder.
