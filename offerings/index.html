    <p class="portfolio-text">
      I help companies leverage AI to accelerate their development workflows and build better software faster. My work spans from hands-on team training to strategic technical leadership, adapting to different stages and needs of growing companies.

    <h2 class="portfolio-section-title">Service Offerings</h2>
    
    <h3 class="portfolio-section-subtitle">AI-Assisted Development Training &amp; Mentoring</h3>
    <p class="portfolio-text">
      <strong>Ready to start immediately</strong> • <strong>Most accessible offering</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="portfolio-text">
      Transform how your team codes with comprehensive training on AI-assisted development workflows. I've been using Cursor since its first release and have witnessed the evolution from primitive chat with copy-paste to automatic file updates, and now agents that loop and update many files at once.
    </p>
    <p class="portfolio-text">
      Your team will learn to think strategically about AI-assisted tools (Cursor Agent Mode, Claude Code, MCP) - understanding what's happening under the hood, recognizing the challenges, and leveraging these tools effectively in their daily workflow.
    </p>
    <p class="portfolio-text">
      <strong>Full-day intensive or two consecutive half-days - your choice based on team preference.</strong>
    </p>
    <ul class="portfolio-list">
      <li><strong>Full-day intensive:</strong> Morning setup + demo, afternoon guided project work. One commitment, done in a day.</li>
      <li><strong>Two consecutive half-days:</strong> Day 1 setup + demo, Day 2 guided project work. Less intensive per day, easier to absorb.</li>
      <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Both avoid momentum loss of spaced sessions and work well for team scheduling</li>
      <li><strong>Audience:</strong> Development teams, engineering managers, and individual developers</li>
      <li><strong>No preliminary consultation required</strong> - we can jump straight into scheduling</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="portfolio-text">
      <em>The consecutive half-days option is often ideal because people can sleep on concepts overnight, it's less mentally exhausting than 8 hours straight, maintains momentum and context, and the environment stays set up between sessions.</em>

    <p class="portfolio-text">

    <h2 class="portfolio-section-title">Why Work With Me?</h2>
    <p class="portfolio-text">
      For over two decades, I've been turning ambitious ideas into scalable software. At <strong><a href="https://www.informatica.com/" class="portfolio-link" target="_blank">Informatica</a></strong>, I re-architected critical systems achieving a <strong>200% performance boost</strong> through linear scaling and dynamic workload distribution. More recently, I've pioneered in Web3 and AI, building <strong><a href="https://8bitoracle.ai" class="portfolio-link" target="_blank">8-Bit Oracle</a></strong> - an innovative digital divination project that <a href="https://x.com/origin_trail/status/1892543087479505352" class="portfolio-link" target="_blank"><strong>won at the Consensus HK Hackathon</strong></a>.
    </p>
    <p class="portfolio-text">
      I've also partnered with driven founders at ventures like <strong><a href="https://www.peepsapp.ai/" class="portfolio-link" target="_blank">People App</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.travelbox.tech/" class="portfolio-link" target="_blank">Travelbox</a></strong>, bringing both deep engineering expertise and a founder's mindset to every challenge.
    </p>
    <p class="portfolio-text">
      Whether you need your team trained on AI workflows, an MVP built, systems scaled, or strategic technical leadership, I offer hard-won experience, cutting-edge technical knowledge, and the relentless drive of a startup builder.

    <h3 class="portfolio-section-subtitle">A Modern Approach to Agreements</h3>
    <p class="portfolio-text">
