    <h2 class="portfolio-section-title">Why Work With Me?</h2>
    <p class="portfolio-text">
      For over two decades, I've been in the business of turning ambitious ideas into tangible, scalable software. I don't just write code; I engineer solutions. My career has been about tackling the hard problems head-on. For example, during my time at 
      <strong><a href="https://www.informatica.com/" class="portfolio-link" target="_blank">Informatica</a></strong>, I re-architected critical systems to achieve a <strong>200% performance boost</strong> by implementing 
      linear scaling and dynamic workload distribution. More recently, I've been pioneering in the Web3 and AI space, building
      <strong><a href="https://8bitoracle.ai" class="portfolio-link" target="_blank">8-Bit Oracle</a></strong>, an innovative project using digital divination that <a href="https://x.com/origin_trail/status/1892543087479505352" class="portfolio-link" target="_blank">won at the <strong>Consensus HK Hackathon</strong></a>.
    </p>
    <p class="portfolio-text">
      I also love partnering with driven founders. I've helped ventures like 
      <strong><a href="https://www.peepsapp.ai/" class="portfolio-link" target="_blank">People App</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.travelbox.tech/" class="portfolio-link" target="_blank">Travelbox</a></strong>, bringing not just deep engineering expertise but also a 
      founder's mindset to every challenge.
    </p>
    <p class="portfolio-text">
      So, whether you need an MVP built, your current systems scaled, or a seasoned technical leader to guide your strategy, 
      I offer a blend of hard-won experience, a knack for cutting-edge tech, and the relentless drive of a startup builder. 
      Here's how we can work together:
