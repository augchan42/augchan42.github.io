# Cursor Rules

## General Principles

- KEEP THINGS SIMPLE.
- Follow DRY Principles, keep components and file sizes small.

## Development Workflow

- Always check rules .cursor/rules when making changes
- If we overcome a big hurdle, we should add a rule to account for it and add it as a learning
- If change is minor, go ahead and apply the change to file instead of asking for confirmation

## Code Standards

- metadata and schema are protected words, do not use them in code!

## Communication

- Please provide percent confidence for any solutions given

## Date Tracking

- Always keep track of today's date as part of .cursor/rules
- Today's date: 2025-08-19
- Update this date whenever working on the rules file

## Blog Post Creation

- Before creating a blog post for this repo, check the doc \_style/style.md
- Run an os command to get the current date
- Follow the Simon Willison style guide for voice, tone, and structure
