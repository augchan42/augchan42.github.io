## Current Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js (app router)
- **Internationalization**: next-intl
- **CSS**: Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase with Auth-UI

## Overview
With the [website](https://8bitoracle.ai) detailing the app's needs, itâ€™s time to set up authentication and beta signups, marking our dive into backend setup.

## Authentication Choices
### Why OAuth2 with Supabase
Chose OAuth2 for its ubiquity. Supabase Auth links directly to PostgreSQL user/profile tables, streamlining user data management.

### Supabase Auth-UI
Implemented [Supabase Auth-UI](https://github.com/supabase-community/auth-ui) for its ease in setting up magic links. Note: no updates since February 2024.

## Web3Auth: Future Considerations
[Web3Auth](https://web3auth.io) is on hold due to its manual database integration requirement.

## OAuth2 Provider Setup
Setting up Google as the OAuth2 provider was essential, ensuring smooth integration with Supabase Auth for automatic database linkage.

## Supabase vs. Firebase
Opted for Supabase over Firebase for its open-source nature and potential for self-hosting.

## Beta Signup Live
The beta signup is live at [8-bit oracle beta signup](https://8bitoracle.ai/en/beta). Check it out.
