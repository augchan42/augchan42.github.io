My Dad was heavily into fortune-telling and the I-Ching.  He did a lot of self study, and even some programming.  I never
quite understood the fascination when I was younger, but now
that I get older, I get more humble about what I know and what is knowable.  Fortune-telling requires recognition of some greater power that you can't fathom.  For technical folks like me that's really off-putting, but now I'm ok with it.

I've gotten more curious about this whole area after my father's death.  He had tons of writings in Chinese that I can't read, tons of partially read books that I've since given away, tons of stuff that I feel was left incomplete.  That's part of the motivation for this project.  I'd like to finish something that he would have really appreciated.  That and I think it would be awfully cool.

**Understanding Yin/Yang lines, Trigrams, and Hexagrams**

One can think of the I-Ching as a 64 entry rainbow table.  However, instead of decoding hashes to passwords, each I-Ching entry is a 6 bit hash of a divination(6 lines form a hexagram, each line can be broken-yin or solid-yang).  Each hexagram has meaning - based on Taoist concepts of yin/yang, energy flow, and nature.  Individual lines in a trigram are read from bottom to top.  And the bottom trigram is read before the top to form a hexagram.  There are 64 entries because 2^6 is 64.

The hexagram and line statements in the I-Ching are actually optional, if you understand the underpinnings.  The broken line is yin which is receptive energy, the solid line is yang which is initiating energy.  Contrary to belief, energy does not always flow from yang-solid lines to yin-broken lines (does day go to night, or night go to day?).  Rather there is interplay and dynamism in how energy flows between yin/yang, and it's a cycle.  It is continuous, dynamic and yin can transform to yang and vice versa.

The position of each line in a Trigram is also important:

Bottom Line - The foundation, youth, new beginnings.  The root or base from which action starts.

Middle Line - The mediator, connector.  Process, growth.  The current state or heart of the matter.

Top Line - culmination/conclusion of the situation.  Maturity, wisdom, final stages of the event.  Leadership, authority.  Represents the Consequences/outcomes/future direction derived from the previous two lines.

The lower trigram is read first and sets the stage (internal states), and the upper trigram represents culmination (outside world).

The imagery and symbolism associated with each trigram can also guide the understanding of energy flow. For example, if the wind (Xun) trigram is below the lake (Dui) trigram, this could symbolize gentle winds spreading over a lake's surface, suggesting a spread of influence or ideas in a calm and steady manner.

If the flow of energy (as understood through the context of a specific situation or reading) seems contrary to the ordering of the lines, this can indicate imbalance, tension, or the need for transformation. For example, a lower trigram full of yang energy surmounted by a yin-dominated upper trigram might suggest a situation where foundational strength and activity (yang) are meeting with receptivity, passivity, or obstacles (yin).

**NFT Minting Process**

Current thinking is the mint process is revealing a fortune specific to your 4 Pillars of Destiny.  So you ask your question, enter your birth hour/day/month/year, and a hexagram is revealed, line by line.  With some cool yarrow stalk animation as each line is revealed.  

As each line is revealed a partial interpretation within the trigram is given.  As each trigram completes, its nature is revealed, energy flow is explained, and a partial interpretation given.  Once both trigrams complete, the final fortune is given, and the interplay between the bottom trigram and top trigram is explained.

The reason for doing it this way is to teach the fundamentals of Taoism and the I-Ching, yin/yang, elements, and nature.
