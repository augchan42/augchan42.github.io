    <p class="portfolio-text">
      Hi.  I'm an engineer and venture builder, passionate about crafting Minimum Viable Products and scaling them. Currently, I'm building products as CTO at <a href="https://digitalrain.studio/" class="portfolio-link" target="_blank">Digital Rain Studios</a>, where we're exploring the frontiers of AI-powered experiences and Web3. My journey into tech began with a BS in Cognitive Science (specializing in Computation) from UC San Diego, after graduating from the Bronx High School of Science.<br><br>
      These days, you'll find me deep in the code for <a href="https://8bitoracle.ai" class="portfolio-link" target="_blank">8-Bit Oracle</a>, an I-Ching digital counselor we successfully launched and which <a href="https://x.com/origin_trail/status/1892543087479505352" class="portfolio-link" target="_blank">won at the Consensus HK Hackathon</a>. 
      It's an immersive tech-noir divination experience available in multiple languages, where users can interact with their destiny using voice, track their divination history, and share insights. The oracle's wisdom is powered by advanced LLMs like DeepSeek—ensuring high-quality readings — with OpenRouter providing ongoing flexibility for the latest AI models. Web3 wallet integration unlocks exclusive token-gated features, and users can even consult the I-Ching on active prediction market events via our live Polymarket integration, powered by the Gamma API.

      I build everything AI-assisted (currently Cursor + Gemini 2.5), a practice that's transformed my workflow. </p> 
    <p class="portfolio-text">I also lend my expertise to other startups, helping them with their MVPs – recent collaborations include <a href="https://www.peepsapp.ai/" class="portfolio-link" target="_blank">People App</a> and <a href="https://www.travelbox.tech/#product" class="portfolio-link" target="_blank">Travelbox</a>.<br><br>

    <p class="portfolio-text">
      Prior to founding <a href="https://digitalrain.studio/" class="portfolio-link" target="_blank">Digital Rain Studios</a>, I spent over a decade at <a href="https://www.informatica.com/" class="portfolio-link" target="_blank">Informatica</a>. As a Development Architect in their Master Data Management division, I was instrumental in enhancing core product performance, notably achieving significant speedups in the fuzzy match engine, and served as a go-to expert for our largest global customers in APAC facing tough technical hurdles. My earlier career spanned roles from Dun & Bradstreet to various tech consulting engagements.<br><br>
